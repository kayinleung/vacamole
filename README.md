# vacamole
-----------
`vacamole` is an R package that features a deterministic age-structured compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model and supporting functions. The model was developed to determine the impacts of different COVID-19 vaccination strategies on disease outcomes; therefore the model is an extended SEIR model to include states for severe disease outcomes and vaccination status.
